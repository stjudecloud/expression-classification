# Interactive t-SNE (DNAnexus Platform App)

Produce a t-SNE plot that highlights input sample(s) against a cohort of existing samples.

This is the source code for an app that runs on the DNAnexus Platform.
For more information about how to run or modify it, see

<!-- Insert a description of your app here -->
This app takes input samples(s) and a tissue type. It then plots the  
t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) for the input samples
relative to a cohort of samples from the same type of tissue curated at St. Jude.  

Laurens van der Maatens and Geoffrey Hinton. Visualizing Data using t-SNE. (2008)

Input samples must have the following properties: "sample_name", "sj_diseases", "sample_type", "library_type", "read_length", "strandedness", and "pairing".

* sample_name: should match the first part of the filename up to the first period (".")
* sj_diseases: a label for the category of the sample
* sample_type: diagnosis, relapse, etc.
* library_type: PolyA or Total_RNA
* read_length: read length in base pair
* strandedness: Stranded-Forward, Stranded-Reverse, or Unstranded
* pairing: Paired_End or Single_End
